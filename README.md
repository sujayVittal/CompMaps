# CompMaps - What is it?
A compass that basically captures the directions, updates the data structure and tries to direct the person to a particular place using the directions retrieved from the data structure.

# Description
CompMaps has a compass that gives directions that are being pointed to. The algorithm runs and stores them in a data structure which can be retrieved later in order to get directions to a place. 
NOTE: the directions can be noticed by plugging the phone and using it in debug mode in android studio. The console will show the recorded directions
